<analysis>
The previous AI engineer was tasked with developing Euridice, a full-stack web application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The core objective was to create a web-based privacy tool exhibiting a Y2K glitch aesthetic that exposes and counters algorithmic surveillance. The development followed a phased approach: initial frontend mock-up, then backend integration. Key decisions included adapting the initial browser extension concept to a web application, incorporating academic frameworks (feminist technoscience, design justice), and implementing both simulated and real-time tracking analysis. The AI focused on building the UI, then setting up backend endpoints for live data collection, and handling user consent. Debugging cycles were observed, particularly around the consent modal and data flow. The Disruption Spell was implemented as a simulation, with the architecture for real functionality laid out, signifying a clear pending task for future iterations.

<product_requirements>
The product, named Euridice, is a browser-based tool aiming to expose and disrupt algorithmic surveillance bias. It combines poetic language, Y2K glitch aesthetics, and a mood-driven interface. The tool allows users to glimpse behind their computer screen, defamiliarizing the web experience and fostering awareness and agency against technofascism.

Key features include:
- **Core Tracking Detection:** Network request, cookie, and fingerprinting detection (canvas, WebRTC, audio context).
- **Visualization:** DOM overlay, real-time data flow visualization, glitch aesthetic filters, interactive tracker network map.
- **Glitch Intervention:** Cookie Poisoning (generating false data, injecting noise into cookies), visual glitch patterns, shader-based effects. The Disruption Spell is a core intervention for scrambling user data.
- **User Interface:** Accessible popup, options page, visual dashboard, help documentation.
- **Design:** Pink, glittery Y2K webcore glitch aesthetic, accessible toggle for clean design. Avoids common color palettes and uses modern components.
- **Transparency & Ethical Considerations:** User consent for data collection, no permanent data distortion/retention (visual augmentation only), environmental impact metrics (carbon footprint, energy usage, data transfer).
- **Academic Context:** Grounded in feminist technoscience and design justice, incorporating concepts from Micha CÃ¡rdenas, Sasha Costanza-Chock, Rosa Menkman, and Thomas S. Mullaney. Uses poetic keyword injections and terms like Metadata Beholder, Digital Spellbook, and Poetic Disruption Spell.

The product transitions from a browser extension concept to a web-based tool.

- **Data Fetching:** Axios for frontend, aiohttp and BeautifulSoup4 for backend web scraping.
- **Frontend Routing:** React Router DOM.
- **State Management:** React  and custom  hook.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom themes for Y2K aesthetic and accessibility.
- **Concurrency:** FastAPI's async capabilities and Motor (async MongoDB driver).

<code_architecture>


- ****:
    - **Summary**: Main React application entry point, setting up  for navigation. Initially contained a basic Hello World API call.
    - **Changes**: Modified to integrate  as the main component for the application's functionality. Removed direct API calls from  component.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: The central component for Euridice's UI and logic. It encapsulates the URL input, analysis display, consent modal, and Disruption Spell functionality.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial implementation with mock data, displaying threat levels, cookie analysis, fingerprinting, and third-party networks.
        - Integrated Y2K glitch aesthetic elements, dynamic backgrounds, and an accessibility toggle.
        - Modified to incorporate poetic keyword injection and academic-themed labels (e.g., Surveillance Scripts instead of Cookie Analysis).
        - Added the consent modal for user permission before performing live analysis.
        - Implemented environmental impact metrics display.
        - Refined logic for switching between educational simulation and real-time analysis, including a critical fix for an infinite loop in the consent flow.
        - Removed a distracting Algorithmic Veil Pierced toast notification.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Stores mock data used by  for frontend-only demonstrations before backend integration.
    - **Changes**: Updated to be more aligned with the academic research context, including poetic keywords and feminist critiques.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: FastAPI backend. Initially had a basic  endpoint and simple  CRUD operations.
    - **Changes**:
        - Added new API endpoints:  for live website analysis,  for real environmental data, and  for the Disruption Spell logic.
        - Integrated  and  for web scraping and content analysis.
        - Implemented logic for parsing cookies and scanning JavaScript for fingerprinting patterns.
        - Added logic for environmental impact calculations based on data transfer and processing.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    - **Changes**: Added , , and  to support web scraping and HTML parsing for live analysis.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: A Markdown file intended to document API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation details, and frontend-backend integration protocols.
    - **Changes**: Updated to reflect the new API endpoints (, , ) and their expected request/response structures, as well as the transition from mock data to real data.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the Disruption Spell to perform actual cookie poisoning/data scrambling and fingerprint obfuscation, rather than just a simulation. This involves generating false browsing patterns and injecting noise into tracking data.

<current_work>
The Euridice application is currently developed as a full-stack privacy tool with a distinct Y2K glitch aesthetic and an accessibility toggle. The frontend is built with React, leveraging Shadcn UI components for a modern look. It features a URL input for website analysis, and displays information across several tabs: Surveillance Scripts (cookie analysis), Biometric Identity Harvesting (fingerprinting), Corporate Networks (third-party tracking), and Poetic Disruption Spell (cookie poisoning).

A critical component implemented is the **Informed Consent Modal**, which prompts users to choose between an Educational Simulation (zero-impact, uses mock data) and Live Website Analysis (real-time data collection with environmental impact metrics). The environmental impact (carbon footprint, energy usage, data transfer) is calculated and displayed for live analysis.

The backend, powered by FastAPI, is set up to perform **real-time website analysis**. This includes live web scraping using  and  to fetch content, parse HTTP headers for actual cookies, and scan JavaScript for fingerprinting techniques. API endpoints (, , ) are in place.

The Poetic Disruption Spell currently functions as a **simulation**. When activated, it shows a visual progress animation and a Digital Chaos Spell Complete toast. While the backend has a  endpoint, the frontend's interaction currently demonstrates a simulated scrambling effect, logging the action for research without actually altering user data. The tool provides clear Educational Simulation vs Live Website Analysis labels for transparency.
