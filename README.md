**Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/helloalligator/Euridice)

Euridice is a **real-time digital resistance platform** that moves beyond traditional privacy tools by actively disrupting surveillance systems rather than simply blocking them. Grounded in **glitch feminist praxis** and **design justice principles**, it transforms users from passive subjects of algorithmic surveillance into active agents of technological resistance.

## üéØ What Euridice Actually Does

### **Real-Time Surveillance Analysis**
- **Live Website Analysis**: Performs actual web scraping to detect tracking cookies, fingerprinting methods, and third-party trackers
- **Threat Assessment**: Calculates accurate threat levels based on detected surveillance mechanisms
- **Algorithmic Shadow Mapping**: Reveals the invisible digital profile being built from your browsing data
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Shows the carbon footprint of surveillance resistance (transparency in action)

### **Active Digital Disruption**
Unlike privacy tools that simply **block** tracking, Euridice actively **feeds false information** to surveillance systems, creating "glitches" in their data collection through:

- **üé® Canvas Fingerprint Scrambling**: Injects dynamic noise into browser rendering every 2-5 seconds
- **üåê WebRTC IP Obfuscation**: Continuously rotates fake local/public IP addresses  
- **üîä Audio Context Disruption**: Adds random distortion to audio processing signatures
- **üìù Font Enumeration Spoofing**: Reports fake font lists to prevent cultural profiling
- **üì± Screen Resolution Chaos**: Randomizes reported display characteristics
- **üç™ Dynamic Cookie Poisoning**: Overwrites tracking cookies with false behavioral data
- **üñ±Ô∏è Behavioral Pattern Disruption**: Generates fake mouse movements and interaction patterns
- **üåä Network Traffic Obfuscation**: Creates background requests to confuse tracking
- **üé≠ Real-Time Identity Rotation**: Cycles through fake browser signatures and preferences

## üéÆ Persona-Based Resistance Gaming

Euridice transforms digital resistance into an engaging experience through **three distinct personas**, each with specialized scrambling techniques:

### **üêô Sentient Octopus**
*Living off the coast of British Columbia, loves caviar, rare books, and puzzles*
- **Specialization**: Multi-tentacled browsing patterns, underwater IP addresses, complex puzzle-solving behavioral signatures
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Methodical, puzzle-solving, book-browsing, caviar-seeking
- **User Agent**: `Mozilla/5.0 (Underwater; Cephalopod OS 8.3; Tentacle/42.0) Ceph/537.36`

### **üåø Greek Folk Hero Euridice**
*Lives in a plant-filled apartment overlooking the Aegean Sea, collects myths and herbs*
- **Specialization**: Privacy-focused browsing, mythology research patterns, herbal wisdom signatures
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Thoughtful, elusive, intentional, archive-browsing, herb-researching
- **User Agent**: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0`

### **ü§ñ Bladerunner Replicant**
*Advanced synthetic being with enhanced capabilities and complex memories*
- **Specialization**: Enhanced precision patterns, synthetic signatures, off-world data streams
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Precise, calculated, enhanced-reflexes, memory-searching, empathy-testing
- **User Agent**: `Mozilla/5.0 (Synthetic; Nexus-7 OS) Tyrell/537.36 Replicant/2019.11`

## üß† Academic & Theoretical Framework

Euridice is grounded in cutting-edge academic research in **feminist technoscience** and **critical algorithm studies**:

### **Glitch Feminist Praxis**
Drawing from **Legacy Russell's "Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto"** and **Rosa Menkman's "The Glitch Moment(um)"**, Euridice uses technological errors and disruptions as sites of creative resistance and transformation.

### **Design Justice Principles**
Following **D'Ignazio and Klein's "Data Feminism"**, the tool challenges power asymmetries in data collection while maintaining complete transparency about its methods and environmental impact.

### **Counter-Surveillance Theory**
Inspired by **Micha C√°rdenas**, **Sasha Costanza-Chock**, and **Thomas S. Mullaney**, Euridice moves beyond "faith-based interactions" with technology to enable informed digital agency.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### **Requirements**
- Node.js 16+ with Yarn package manager
- Python 3.9+ with FastAPI
- MongoDB database
- Modern web browser

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/helloalligator/Euridice.git
cd euridice

# Install dependencies
cd frontend && yarn install
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start services
sudo supervisorctl start all

# Access at https://your-domain.com
```

### **Usage Flow**
1. **Enter website URL** to analyze (e.g., facebook.com, google.com)
2. **Review consent modal** for real-time analysis permissions
3. **Begin analysis** to reveal surveillance infrastructure
4. **Choose your persona** (Octopus, Euridice, or Replicant)
5. **Cast disruption spell** to begin continuous real-time scrambling

## üåç Environmental Impact & Transparency

### **Carbon Footprint Calculation**
- **Data Transfer**: ~0.5g CO‚ÇÇ per MB transferred during analysis
- **Server Processing**: ~0.1g CO‚ÇÇ per second of analysis time  
- **Network Requests**: ~0.1g CO‚ÇÇ per HTTP request made
- **Continuous Scrambling**: ~0.02-0.05g CO‚ÇÇ per hour of browser processing

### **Why We Track This**
> *"Every act of surveillance detection requires computational resources‚Äîawareness enables more mindful digital resistance practices."*

Environmental transparency aligns with **design justice principles** by making the material costs of resistance visible, enabling users to make conscious choices about their digital agency.

All disruption actions are logged for research transparency:
- **Timestamp and URL** of analysis
- **Cookies poisoned** and scrambling techniques deployed  
- **Environmental impact** of each operation
- **Persona selection** and behavioral pattern data

**No personal data is permanently stored** - all logging focuses on system behavior, not user identification.
