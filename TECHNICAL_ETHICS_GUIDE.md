## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation: How the Code Actually Works

### **Frontend Architecture (React + Shadcn UI)**

#### **State Management**
```javascript
// Core application state
const [analysisData, setAnalysisData] = useState(null);          // Analysis results
const [isSpellActive, setIsSpellActive] = useState(false);       // Disruption status
const [selectedPersona, setSelectedPersona] = useState(null);    // Chosen identity
const [environmentalImpact, setEnvironmentalImpact] = useState(null); // Carbon metrics
```

#### **Real-Time Analysis Flow**
```javascript
const performRealTimeAnalysis = async () => {
  // 1. Format URL with proper protocol
  let formattedUrl = url.startsWith('http') ? url : `https://${url}`;
  
  // 2. Call backend analysis API
  const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/analyze`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      url: formattedUrl,
      options: {
        includeBrowserCookies: browserCookiesConsent,
        includeWebScraping: true,  // Always true for real-time analysis
        includeFingerprinting: true,
        includeEnvironmentalMetrics: true
      }
    })
  });
  
  // 3. Process and display results
  const data = await response.json();
  setAnalysisData(data);
  setEnvironmentalImpact(data.environmentalImpact);
};
```

#### **Persona-Based Disruption**
```javascript
const executePoison = async (persona = 'octopus') => {
  // 1. Start browser-side scrambling with persona
  const scramblerResult = realTimeScrambler.castSpell(persona);
  setIsSpellActive(true);
  
  // 2. Coordinate with backend for logging
  const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/poison`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      url: analysisData.url,
      domain: analysisData.domain,
      poisonLevel: "aggressive",
      targetCookies: analysisData.cookies.map(c => c.name),
      persona: persona
    })
  });
};
```

### **Backend Architecture (FastAPI + MongoDB)**

#### **Real-Time Web Analysis**
```python
@api_router.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_website(request: AnalysisRequest):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # 1. Perform live web scraping
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(request.url, timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=10)) as response:
            content = await response.text()
            headers = dict(response.headers)
    
    # 2. Parse actual cookies from HTTP headers
    cookies = []
    if 'Set-Cookie' in headers:
        cookie_header = headers['Set-Cookie']
        # Parse real cookie data...
    
    # 3. Analyze JavaScript for fingerprinting
    soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
    scripts = soup.find_all('script')
    fingerprinting_methods = []
    for script in scripts:
        if script.string and any(keyword in script.string for keyword in 
                               ['canvas', 'webrtc', 'audioCcontext', 'screen']):
            fingerprinting_methods.append(detected_method)
    
    # 4. Calculate environmental impact
    processing_time = time.time() - start_time
    data_size = len(content.encode('utf-8'))
    carbon_footprint = (data_size / 1024 / 1024) * 0.5 + processing_time * 0.1  # MB * 0.5g + time * 0.1g
    
    # 5. Store analysis for research transparency
    analysis_record = {
        "url": request.url,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "cookies_found": len(cookies),
        "fingerprinting_methods": len(fingerprinting_methods),
        "carbon_footprint": f"{carbon_footprint:.3f}g CO‚ÇÇ",
        "processing_time": processing_time
    }
    await db.analysis_logs.insert_one(analysis_record)
    
    return analysis_response
```

#### **Disruption Logging & Coordination**
```python
@api_router.post("/poison")
async def execute_poison(request: PoisonRequest):
    # 1. Generate server-side false data
    poisoned_cookies = []
    for cookie_name in request.targetCookies:
        poisoned_cookies.append({
            "name": cookie_name,
            "originalValue": "***obfuscated***",
            "poisonedValue": _generate_false_tracking_data(cookie_name, request.persona),
            "technique": "persona-based confusion"
        })
    
    # 2. Log disruption action for research
    poison_record = {
        "url": request.url,
        "persona": request.persona,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "techniques_deployed": 9,
        "cookies_poisoned": len(poisoned_cookies),
        "environmental_impact": f"{processing_time * 0.05:.4f}g CO‚ÇÇ"
    }
    await db.poison_actions.insert_one(poison_record)
    
    return disruption_results
```

### **Browser-Side Real-Time Scrambling**

#### **Persona-Specific Data Injection**
```javascript
class RealTimeScrambler {
  castSpell(persona = 'octopus') {
    this.currentPersona = persona;
    const personaData = this.personas[persona];
    
    // Start all 9 scrambling techniques with persona-specific data
    this.startCanvasScrambling();      // Inject persona-themed noise
    this.startWebRTCObfuscation();     // Use persona location data
    this.startAudioContextDisruption(); // Persona-specific audio signatures
    this.startFontEnumerationSpoofing(); // Report persona font preferences
    this.startScreenResolutionChaos();  // Use persona screen setups
    this.startDynamicCookiePoisoning(); // Inject persona interests
    this.startBehavioralPatternDisruption(); // Mimic persona behavior
    this.startNetworkTrafficObfuscation(); // Generate persona requests
    this.startRealTimeIdentityRotation(); // Cycle persona identities
  }
  
  startDynamicCookiePoisoning() {
    const poisonCookies = () => {
      const personaData = this.personas[this.currentPersona];
      const interest = personaData.interests[Math.floor(Math.random() * personaData.interests.length)];
      
      // Overwrite tracking cookies with persona interests
      ['_ga', '_gid', '_fbp', '_fbc', '__utma', '__utmz', '_hjid'].forEach(cookieName => {
        const fakeValue = `${interest.replace(/\s+/g, '_')}_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
        document.cookie = `${cookieName}=${fakeValue}; path=/; max-age=3600`;
      });
    };
    
    // Poison cookies every 10-30 seconds
    const interval = setInterval(poisonCookies, 10000 + Math.random() * 20000);
    this.intervals.push(interval);
    poisonCookies(); // Initial poisoning
  }
}
```

## üåç Environmental Impact: The Carbon Cost of Digital Resistance

### **Detailed Carbon Footprint Analysis**

#### **Real-Time Analysis Phase**
```
Carbon Footprint = Data Transfer + Server Processing + Network Requests
                 = (MB transferred √ó 0.5g CO‚ÇÇ) + (seconds processing √ó 0.1g CO‚ÇÇ) + (requests √ó 0.1g CO‚ÇÇ)

Example for facebook.com:
- Data Transfer: 80.2 KB = 0.078 MB √ó 0.5g = 0.039g CO‚ÇÇ
- Server Processing: 0.35 seconds √ó 0.1g = 0.035g CO‚ÇÇ  
- Network Requests: 1 request √ó 0.1g = 0.1g CO‚ÇÇ
- Total: 0.174g CO‚ÇÇ per analysis
```

#### **Continuous Scrambling Phase**
```
Ongoing Impact = Browser Processing + Network Obfuscation
               = (CPU cycles √ó energy efficiency √ó carbon intensity) + (fake requests √ó 0.1g CO‚ÇÇ)

Estimated Impact:
- Browser Processing: ~0.02-0.05g CO‚ÇÇ per hour
- Network Obfuscation: ~0.01g CO‚ÇÇ per hour (1 fake request every 15-40 minutes)
- Total: ~0.03-0.06g CO‚ÇÇ per hour of active disruption
```

### **Environmental Justice Considerations**

#### **Why We Track Environmental Impact**
1. **Transparency**: Users deserve to know the material cost of their digital resistance
2. **Conscious Choice**: Environmental awareness enables more mindful activism
3. **Systemic Critique**: Highlights that surveillance systems also have environmental costs
4. **Research Integrity**: Academic research must account for its own environmental impact

#### **Comparative Environmental Context**
```
Euridice Usage vs Other Digital Activities:
- 1 hour of Euridice disruption: ~0.05g CO‚ÇÇ
- 1 Google search: ~0.2g CO‚ÇÇ
- 1 minute of YouTube: ~1.76g CO‚ÇÇ
- 1 hour of Netflix: ~36g CO‚ÇÇ
- Bitcoin transaction: ~741,000g CO‚ÇÇ

Perspective: Running Euridice for 20 hours = environmental impact of 1 Google search
```

### **Environmental Mitigation Strategies**

#### **Built-in Optimizations**
1. **Efficient Algorithms**: Scrambling techniques optimized for minimal CPU usage
2. **Smart Timing**: Dynamic intervals prevent unnecessary processing
3. **Local Processing**: Browser-side operations reduce server load
4. **Minimal Network**: Fake requests use HEAD method, not full downloads

#### **User Education**
1. **Real-time Impact Display**: Users see live carbon footprint
2. **Conscious Activation**: Spell must be actively cast, not automatic
3. **Easy Deactivation**: Users can dispel spell when not needed
4. **Environmental Awareness**: Interface explains why tracking matters
